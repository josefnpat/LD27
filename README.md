# Defense of Your Craft

Theme: 10 Seconds

### Build for 10 seconds and then fight off the attackers with your friends!


Defend your space station in this free-form tower defense game with up to five players! Use the money you accumulate to build more defenses, but be quick; you only have 10 seconds until the next wave!

Choose between three different classes:

* Soldier - Short range, but he packs a punch. His special is a shield boost that absorbs a lot of damage!
* Ranger - Long range, and faster than the rest. His special is a explosive area discharge! (You don't earn money with the special!)
* Medic - Pretty dopey, but his special is the only thing that can heal in the game!
